# Introduction

## # What is Basil

Basil is a lightweight UI framework made with the goal of bridging the gap between developers who like using UI frameworks and those who prefer styling apps without them.

By using Basil you speed up your development by only sprinkling the bare minimum of basil on your spaghetti code. Basil only uses CSS grids, flexbox, fontsize, margin, padding and media queries. That leaves you to style the rest of the app with whatever CSS method you want.

If a product is build originally with Basil, the maintainer can jump into the prjoect and change it simply by adding more CSS classes the way he likes best, thus embracing the complexity and chatotic nature of maintaning CSS.
